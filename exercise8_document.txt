What I Have Done:
I created a Python script that combines data from two different APIs: 
one providing hourly electricity prices and another providing wind power generation data. 
The goal is to analyze whether there is a correlation between electricity prices 
and wind power generation.

Sources:
Electricity Price API: ENTSO-E Transparency Platform
Wind Power Generation API: OpenWeatherMap

AI use:
I did use AI for getting ideas for what APIs I could combine. AI also helped me 
to debug the code.
